# Pokédex 🧠🎮

This is a learner project built as part of Shadow Health's onboarding and training curriculum. The goal of this application is to get hands-on experience with **Ruby on Rails** while building a fully functional Pokédex that interacts with the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## 📚 What I Learned

Throughout this project, I focused on learning and applying core Rails concepts while writing clean and maintainable code. Key takeaways include:

- ✅ Understanding general **Rails syntax and structure**
- ✅ Writing and organizing **helper methods** for cleaner views
- ✅ Using **service objects** to separate logic from controllers
- ✅ Implementing **caching** strategies to minimize API calls
- ✅ Building **RESTful routes** and organizing partials properly
- ✅ Following Rails conventions for a scalable and readable codebase
