# PokÃ©dex ðŸ§ ðŸŽ®

This is a learner project built as part of Shadow Health's onboarding and training curriculum. The goal of this application is to get hands-on experience with **Ruby on Rails** while building a fully functional PokÃ©dex that interacts with the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
_______________________________________________________________________________

Throughout this project, I focused on learning and applying core Rails concepts while attempting to write clean and maintainable code.

-  Understanding general **Rails syntax and structure**
-  Writing and organizing **helper methods** for cleaner views
-  Using **service objects** to separate logic from controllers
-  Implementing **caching** strategies to minimize API calls
-  Building **RESTful routes** and organizing partials properly
-  Following Rails conventions for a scalable and readable codebase94cedb

## Features

- Search and view any PokÃ©mon using the PokeAPI
- View stats, types, abilities, and sprites
- Dynamically fetch and cache PokÃ©mon data
- Responsive and styled with **Tailwind CSS**
